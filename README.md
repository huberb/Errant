My own attempt on programming the Biterrant attack

Resources:
  - biterrant.io (internet archive snapshot in repo)
  - https://github.com/skelsec/BitErrant (PoC)

TODO:
  - generate two different executables with the same torrent file
  - port the original PoC to Linux
  - write/find sth that generates shellcode, read up on shellcode
