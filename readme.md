My approach on the BitErrant Attack

DONE:
    1. learn about shattered
    2. port PoC to Unix
    3. experiment with the PDFs
        - they can be cut to any number of bytes and still produce the same hash
        - they can be concatenated with zero bytes and still produce the same hash
    4. find out more about C++ Binaries
        - they can be concatenated with zero bytes and still execute like before

    -> we can create any size of torrent pieces!


TODO:
    1. find out how to create the perfect sized assembly
    2. read up on C++ Sections
    3. simplify proof of concept
