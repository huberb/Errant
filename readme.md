My approach on the BitErrant Attack

DONE:

    1. learn about shattered

    2. port PoC to Unix

    3. experiment with the PDFs

        - they can be cut to any number of bytes and still produce the same hash
        - they can be concatenated with zero bytes and still produce the same hash

    4. find out more about C++ Binaries

        - they can be concatenated with zero bytes and still execute like before

        so we can create any size of torrent pieces!

    5. create two different binaries with the same torrent file

    6. make them execute depending on a hidden switch

TODO:

    3. simplify proof of concept
